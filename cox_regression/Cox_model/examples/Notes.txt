random_data, and random_data_same_folder are based on the same example (whereas random_grouped_data, random_grouped_data_same_folder and random_grouped_data_with_weights_same_folder) are based on the same example where the data was aggregated).

The first one has the files separated in different folders to better mimic a distributed environment. To run, you need to copy the results across folders, which clarifies what is sent where.

The second example is based on the same dataset, but if you simply want to look at the output, everything is happening in the same folder, without the need to copy files across folders.



lung_data_same_folder is an example based on the "lung" dataset in R (whereas lung_data_grouped_same_folder is based on the same example where the data was aggregated).



breast_data, breast_data_same_folder, breast_data_with_weights_same_folder are based on the same example. They both use the "Breast Cancer Dataset" from Royston and Altman (2013).

The first one has the files separated in different folders to better mimic a distributed environment. To run, you need to copy the results across folders, which clarifies what is sent where.

The second example is based on the same dataset, but if you simply want to look at the output, everything is happening in the same folder, without the need to copy files across.

The third example is based on the same dataset alongside weights files. Everything is happening in the same folder, without the need to copy files across.



*** Optional : if you want to try to generate new test datasets, the file "cox_data_generation.R" might be useful.
