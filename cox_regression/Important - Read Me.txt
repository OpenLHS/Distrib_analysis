:::::: IMPORTANT NOTES BEFORE USING ::::::

- **The Cox model does not ensure data privacy by itself. The data must be aggregated first to ensure confidentiality. (See the folder Data_preparation) **

- Adjust the number of files "Data_node_call_cox-reg_k.R" according to the number of nodes, and make sure to change the value of "manualk" to the node number.

- To start over, it is important to delete all "output" files.

- The code currently works only with complete data (incomplete data with NA values should not make the code crash, but will cause calculation errors).

- Each folder at the current level contains a "Data Requirements.txt" file which should be read thoroughly before running any code.
