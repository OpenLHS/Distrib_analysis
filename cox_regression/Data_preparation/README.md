# Data preparation

This algorithm allows one to group data using the `time` variable of a Cox regression.

## Table of contents

## Repository structure

- Examples  
The examples folder contains a few examples. Each example folder is self-contained. Therefore, some files will be duplicated across examples, but this is to facilitate their exploration independantly.

- Generic_code  
The generic_code folder contains examplar `R` code files pertaining to the distributed approach and its pooled comparator. Please read the code and its comments in the `R` file as files may require edition before being used.

### List of examples

- Average  
Orders the data by time and averages the time values across a specified number of individuals.

### Generic code

The files in this folder can be used to support an example of aggregating the times of a dataset.  
Assuming a data structure similar to the data nodes `.csv` files in the example folder, this code can be used to execute a data node operation or a coordination node operation for a Cox model.

## Instructions to run the examples/algorithm

There are many ways to run `R` code. The proposed instructions here are focusing on using a graphical interface.

### Installing R and R Studion

1. Go to the page : https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ and follow the instructions for your operating system

### Installing the required packages

The algorithm currently requires the use of package(s) not present in the base installation. R should prompt you to download the packages automatically.

- [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html)

Furthermore, the examples will be easier to explore and adapt/change if the package `this.path` is also available. Yet this is NOT required and you can safely ignore any warning about this is if you want to use the algorithm "as-is". Should you choose not to use this package, you will need to manually set your working sirectory in your `R` instance.

- [this.path](https://cran.r-project.org/package=this.path)

If you work in an isolated environment, you might need to download them manually at the adress above and install them for your `RStudio` instance. While describing the process here is out of scope, a web search will yield resources like https://riptutorial.com/r/example/5556/install-package-from-local-source that can be helpful.

### Installing an example

1. Unpack one of the example folders on one of your drives.

### Executing the code 

***Make sure `R studio` is not currently running and close it if it is.***  
***If you are not able to automatically set your working directory, manually set the variable `manualwd = 1` in `Data_node_call_cox-reg_k.R` and  `Coord_node_call_iter_cox-reg.R`.***

1. In the file `data_node_call_precox_average.R`, select all the code and execute it. A new file will be generated, which contains the original data with modified times.
2. This data can now be used by a data node to participate into a privacy preserving Cox model.

## Expected outputs

### Data node side

| Step | Files created |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Data preparation | `Data_node_grouped_k.csv` |

### Coordination node side

The coordination node should not use this feature.
