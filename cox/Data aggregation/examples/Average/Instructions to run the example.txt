There are many ways to run R code. The proposed instructions here are focusing on using a graphical interface

:::::: INSTALLING R and R STUDIO ::::::
1)	Go to the page : https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ and follow the instructions for your operating system

:::::: INSTALLING THE REQUIRED PACKAGES ::::::
: The examples require the use a package not present in the base installation :
- dplyr : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf

: The examples will be easier to explore and adapt/change if the package "this.path" is also available.
- this.path : https://cran.r-project.org/package=this.path https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/this.path/this.path.pdf
- Yet this is NOT required and you can safely ignore any warning about this is if you want to use the examples "as-is".

: R should prompt you to download the packages automatically

1)	If you work in an isolated environment, you might need to download them manually at the adress above and install them for your RStudio instance
: While describing the process here is out of scope, a web search will yield resources like https://riptutorial.com/r/example/5556/install-package-from-local-source that can be helpful.

:::::: INSTALLING THE EXAMPLE ::::::
1)	Unpack one of the example folders on one of your drives


:::::: EXECUTING THE CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
*** If you are not able to automatically set your working directory, manually set the variable manualwd = 1

1)	In the file "Average - Local - sitex.R", select all the code and execute it, for all sites. A new file will be generated, which contains the original data with modified times.
2)	This data can now be used for a privacy preserving Cox model.
