There are many ways to run R code. The proposed instructions here are focusing on using a graphical interface

:::::: INSTALLING R and R STUDIO ::::::
1)	Go to the page : https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ and follow the instructions for your operating system

: The examples will be easier to explore and adapt/change if the package "this.path" is also available.
- this.path : https://cran.r-project.org/package=this.path https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/this.path/this.path.pdf
- Yet this is NOT required and you can safely ignore any warning about this is if you want to use the examples "as-is".

: R should prompt you to download the packages automatically

1)	If you work in an isolated environment, you might need to download them manually at the adress above and install them for your RStudio instance
: While describing the process here is out of scope, a web search will yield resources like https://riptutorial.com/r/example/5556/install-package-from-local-source that can be helpful.

:::::: INSTALLING THE EXAMPLE ::::::
1)	Unpack one of the example folders on one of your drives


:::::: EXECUTING THE CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
*** If you are not able to automatically set your working directory, manually set the variable manualwd = 1

Before executing the code, make sure the parameters in "Parameters.csv" are set to the right value (see next section).

1)	In all the local files, set the parameter left_percent_excluded and right_percent_excluded to the percentage of values you want to exclude on the left and right side of the distribution. The default value is 2 (%).

2)	In the file "Non-uniform intervals - Local - sitex.R", select all the code and execute it for all sites. The cutoff values will be computed and saved in a CSV ("Cutoff_site_x.csv").
3)	In the file "Non-uniform intervals - Global", select all the code and execute it. The global cutoff values will be computed and saved in a CSV ("Global_cutoff.csv").

4)	In the file "Non-uniform intervals - Local - sitex.R", select all the code and execute it, for all sites. A new file will be generated for every site ("Binary_output_site_x.csv"), which contains a matrix.
5)	In the file "Non-uniform intervals - Global.R", select all the code and execute it. A file will be generated ("Global_intervals.csv"), which contains the border values of the intervals.

6)	In the file "Non-uniform intervals - Local - sitex.R", select all the code and execute it for all sites. The original data with modified times will be saved in a CSV ("Grouped_Data_site_x.csv").
7)	This data can now be used for a privacy-preserving Cox model.


:::::: PARAMETERS TO AJUST ::::::

The parameters should be determined by the central server and must not be modified by the local sites. The key parameters are as follows:

- nbDataGrouped : This is the number of subjects that will be grouped together. The recommended value is 5.
- interval_size : This is the initial size of the intervals.
- increase : This is the value by which the size of the intervals increases.
- step : This is the value by which the start of the interval will be moved.
