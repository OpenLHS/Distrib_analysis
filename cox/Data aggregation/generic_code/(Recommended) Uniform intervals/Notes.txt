Order of execution:

1. Non-uniform intervals - Local
: Generate local cutoff values

2. Non-uniform intervals - Global
: Generate global cutoff values

3. Non-uniform intervals - Local
: Generate matrix locally

4. Non-uniform intervals - Global
: Determine intervals

5. Non-uniform intervals - Local
: Split data according to partition

*** Before executing the code, make sure the parameters in "Parameters.csv" are set to the right value (see next section).

:::::: PARAMETERS TO AJUST ::::::

The parameters should be determined by the central server and must not be modified by the local sites. The key parameters are as follows:

- nbDataGrouped : This is the number of subjects that will be grouped together. The recommended value is 5.
- increase : This is the value by which the size of the interval increases. The recommended value is 1, or the minimum distance between time values.
