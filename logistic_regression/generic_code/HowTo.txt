The examples already contain examplar datasets.
Should you want to try generate different datasets, the DataNodeDistrib_generation.R could be helpful (but it is not required).

To test the example:
1. 	unpack all folders separately
2. 	run the bat file (or the corresponding r file) for each data node to initiate the process
3. 	take each output file generated (tagged "iter_0") and copy all three in the coordination node folder
4. 	run the coordination bat file (or the corresponding r file)

To run an iteration:
5. 	copy the primer csv file to each of the three data node folders
6. 	run the bat file (or the corresponding r file) for each data node to initiate the process
7. 	take each output file generated (tagged with the most recent iteration number) and copy all three in the coordination node folder
8. 	run the coordination bat file (or the corresponding r file)
**	step #8 will generate but the estimators for this iteration and a primer file to be used if another iteration is desired
9.	optional : compare the results of the previous iteration with the current one to decide if another iteration is pertinent or not
