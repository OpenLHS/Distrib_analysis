:::::: DATA REQUIREMENTS (logistic_regression) ::::::

- Data is expected to be saved in a .csv file.

- The first column of your Data file must be the outcome variable and must be named "out1". This variable must use the values 0 or 1, where 1 indicates a success (or having the characteristic).

- All other columns (predictor variables) must be in the same order and must share the same names across nodes.

- Each level for categorical variables is expected to have been possible to sample across all nodes. Otherwise, said level should either be removed or merged with another level.

- Categorical variables must be binarized before running this code. Binarized variables must use the values 0 or 1, where 1 indicates a success (or having the characteristic).

- (optional) Weights are expected to be saved in a .csv file.
