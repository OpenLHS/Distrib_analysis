There are many ways to run R code. The proposed instructions here are focusing on using a graphical interface

:::::: INSTALLING R and R STUDIO ::::::
1)	Go to the page : https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ and follow the instructions for your operating system

:::::: INSTALLING THE REQUIRED PACKAGES :::::: 
: There are no package not present in the base installation that are a requirement for this code to run.

: The examples will be easier to explore and adapt/change if the packages "this.path" and "rstudioapi" are also available.
- this.path : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/this.path/index.html
- rstudioapi: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstudioapi/index.html
- Yet this is NOT required and you can safely ignore any warning about this is if you want to use the examples "as-is".

: R should prompt you to download the packages automatically

1)	If you work in an isolated environment, you might need to download them manually at the adress above and install them for your RStudio instance
: While describing the process here is out of scope, a web search will yield resources like https://riptutorial.com/r/example/5556/install-package-from-local-source that can be helpful.

:::::: INSTALLING THE EXAMPLE ::::::
1)	Unpack one of the example folders on one of your drives
: In it, you should find two folders : a) "pooled" and b) "distributed"

:::::: EXECUTING THE CENTRALISED CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
1)	Navigate to the folder "pooled"

2)	Open the file "pooled_log_reg_example.R". It should then appear in R.
3)	Select all the code and click "run"
4)	The results will be available in the console

:::::: EXECUTING THE DISTRIBUTED CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
*** If you are not able to automatically set your working directory, manually set the variable manualwd = 1 in Data_node_call_log-reg.R and Coord_node_call_iter_log-reg.R
1) 	Run the bat file (for windows users) or the corresponding r file (Data_node_call_log-reg.R) for each data node to initiate the process
2) 	Take each output file generated (tagged "iter_0") and copy all three in the coordination node folder
3)	Run the coordination bat file (for windows users) or the corresponding r file (Coord_node_call_iter_log-reg.R)

Then, to perform an iteration:
4) 	Copy the primer csv file to each of the three data node folders
5) 	run the bat file (or the corresponding r file) for each data node
6) 	take each output file generated (tagged with the most recent iteration number) and copy all three in the coordination node folder
7) 	run the coordination bat file (or the corresponding r file)
**	this step will generate but the estimators for this iteration and a primer file to be used if another iteration is desired
8)	optional : compare the results of the previous iteration with the current one to decide if another iteration is pertinent (return to step 4) or not
