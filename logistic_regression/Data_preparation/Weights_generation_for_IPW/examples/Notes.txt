Random_data and Random_data_same_folder are based on the same example.

The first one has the files separated in different folders to better mimic a distributed environment. To run, you need to copy the results across folders, which clarifies what is sent where.

The second example is based on the same dataset, but if you simply want to look at the output, everything is happening in the same folder, wihtout the need to copy files across.



MatchIt_data and MatchIt_data_same_folder are based on the same example. They both use the "Lalonde" data sets from the r package "MatchIt". 
See: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/index.html

The first one has the files separated in different folders to better mimic a distributed environment. To run, you need to copy the results across folders, which clarifies what is sent where.

The second example is based on the same dataset, but if you simply want to look at the output, everything is happening in the same folder, without the need to copy files across.

Usecase: linear regression (y = re75) and logistic regression (y = ???)



Breast_data and Breast_data_same_folder are based on the same example. They both use the "Breast Cancer Dataset" from Royston and Altman (2013). 
See: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/breast-cancer-dataset-used-royston-and-altman

The first one has the files separated in different folders to better mimic a distributed environment. To run, you need to copy the results across folders, which clarifies what is sent where.

The second example is based on the same dataset, but if you simply want to look at the output, everything is happening in the same folder, without the need to copy files across.

Usecase: Cox_Model


*** Optional : if you want to try to generate new test datasets, the file "DataNodeDistrib_generation.R" might be useful.
