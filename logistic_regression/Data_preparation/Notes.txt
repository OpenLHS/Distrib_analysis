The folders aims at containing different methods to compute weights for individuals which may be used afterwards in a GLM. 
Currently, only one method is available.

1. Weights_generation_for_IPW 
: computes the propensity score of an individual and the inverse probability weight associated with that score, using distributed logistic regression.
: note that most assets from our distributed logistic regression algorithm are reused here.
