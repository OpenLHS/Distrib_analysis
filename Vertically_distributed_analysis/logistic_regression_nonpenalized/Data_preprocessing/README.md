# Data preprocessing

This folder contains instructions on how to split the response node's data, which must be done before running this vertically distributed logistic regression model.

## Response node split

This code allows the  response node split its data in two parts:
- `outcome_data.csv`, a single column dataset which corresponds to the outcome variable.
- `Data_node_k.csv`, which corresponds to all other predictors available at the response node.
