There are many ways to run R code. The proposed instructions here are focusing on using a graphical interface

:::::: INSTALLING R and R STUDIO ::::::
1) Go to the page : https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ and follow the instructions for your operating system

:::::: INSTALLING THE REQUIRED PACKAGES ::::::
: The example requires the use of two packages not present in the base installation :
- KS : https://cran.r-project.org/package=ks https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ks/ks.pdf
- this.path : https://cran.r-project.org/package=this.path https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/this.path/this.path.pdf

: R should prompt you to download the packages automatically

1) If you work in an isolated environment, you might need to download them manually at the adress above and install them for your RStudio instance
: While describing the process here is out of scope, a web search will yield resources like https://riptutorial.com/r/example/5556/install-package-from-local-source that can be helpful.

:::::: INSTALLING THE EXAMPLE ::::::
1) Unpack the example files on one of your drives
: You should end up with a folder containg two folders : a) "Centralised_inference" and b) "Distributed_inference"

:::::: EXECUTING THE CENTRALISED CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
1) Navigate to the folder "Centralised_inference"

2) Open the file "PoolingOrg_code_lin_reg.R". It should then appear in R.
3) Select all the code and click "run"
4) The result file ("PoolingOrg_results_centralised_lin_reg.csv") will be created. You can open it to see the results.

:::::: EXECUTING THE DISTRIBUTED CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
1) Navigate to the folder "Distributed_inference"

2) Open the file "Node1_code_lin-reg.R". It should then appear in R.
3) Select all the code and click "run"
:  The intermediate outputs for the data node 1 will be created ("Node1_output.csv")

4) Open the file "Node2_code_lin-reg.R". It should then appear in R.
5) Select all the code and click "run"
:  The intermediate outputs for the data node 1 will be created ("Node2_output.csv")

6) Open the file "CoordNode_code_lin-reg.R". It should then appear in R
7) Select all the code and click "run"

8) The result file ("CoordNode_results_distributed_lin_reg.csv") will be created. You can open it to see the results.
