The file "Data-node_core_code_lin-reg.R" contains the actual analytical code to be used by data nodes to generate the intermediate results to be sent to the coordination node. It contains a function taking a node identifier as a parameter.

The core code is meant to be called by another R file "Data-node_X_call_lin-reg.R". To use it, please change the "X" in the file name to a data node identifier and, if the this.path package is not available, please manually input the node identifier in the code where indicated.
If the this.path package is available, the node identifier will be infered automatically from the file name.

The file "CoordNode_code_lin-reg.R" needs to be colocated with a set of data nodes intermediate results to execute the final calculations to generate the linear regression results.

The subfoler "pooled_comparator" contains code that can be used to execute a traditional pooled linear regression.
