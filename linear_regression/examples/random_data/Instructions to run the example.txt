There are many ways to run R code. The proposed instructions here are focusing on using a graphical interface

:::::: INSTALLING R and R STUDIO ::::::
1)	Go to the page : https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ and follow the instructions for your operating system

:::::: INSTALLING THE REQUIRED PACKAGES ::::::
: The examples require the use a package not present in the base installation :
- KS : https://cran.r-project.org/package=ks https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ks/ks.pdf

: The examples will be easier to explore and adapt/change if the package "this.path" is also available.
- this.path : https://cran.r-project.org/package=this.path https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/this.path/this.path.pdf
- Yet this is NOT required and you can safely ignore any warning about this is if you want to use the examples "as-is".

: R should prompt you to download the packages automatically

1)	If you work in an isolated environment, you might need to download them manually at the adress above and install them for your RStudio instance
: While describing the process here is out of scope, a web search will yield resources like https://riptutorial.com/r/example/5556/install-package-from-local-source that can be helpful.

:::::: INSTALLING THE EXAMPLE ::::::
1)	Unpack one of the example folders on one of your drives
: In it, you should find two folders : a) "pooled" and b) "distributed"

:::::: EXECUTING THE CENTRALISED CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
1)	Navigate to the folder "pooled"

2)	Open the file "PoolingOrg_code_lin_reg.R". It should then appear in R.
3)	Select all the code and click "run"
4)	The results will be available in the console

:::::: EXECUTING THE DISTRIBUTED CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
1) 	Run the bat file (for windows users) or the corresponding r file (Data_node_call_lin-reg_X.R) for each data node to initiate the process
2) 	Take each output file generated and copy all in the coordination node folder
3)	Run the coordination bat file (for windows users) or the corresponding r file (Coord_node_lin-reg.R)
