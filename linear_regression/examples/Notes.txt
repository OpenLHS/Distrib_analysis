random_data, random_data_same_folder and random_data_same_folder_missing are based on the same example.

The first one has the files separated in different folders to better mimic a distributed environment. To run, you need to copy the results across folders, which clarifies what is sent where.

The second example is based on the same dataset, but if you simply want to look at the output, everything is happening in the same folder, without the need to copy files across folders.

The third example is based on the same dataset, but has some missing values. It shows how the complete case analysis will be done and how original data will be kept.



newborn_data_same_folder is yet another example.
