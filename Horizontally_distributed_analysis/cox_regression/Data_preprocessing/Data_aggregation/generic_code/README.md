# Generic code

The files in this folder can be used to support an example of aggregating the times of a dataset.
Assuming a data structure similar to the data nodes `.csv` files in the example folder, this code can be used to execute an aggregation of individuals for a data node.

## Data requirements

- Data is expected to be saved in a `.csv` file. 
- The code is written so that `0 = censored` and `1 = event` for the `status` variable. Make sure to follow this structure with your dataset.
- The first two columns of your data file must be named `time` and `status` (order not important).
