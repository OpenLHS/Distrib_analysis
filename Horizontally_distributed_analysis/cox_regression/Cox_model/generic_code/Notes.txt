The files in this folder can be used to support an example of distributed survival analysis with a Cox model.

Assuming a data structure similar to the data nodes CSV files in the example folder, this code can be used to execute a data node operation or a coordination node operation for a Cox model.

If you want to use RStudio, for the data node, you can source "Data_node_call_cox-reg_k.R", and for the coordination node, it is "Coord_node_call_iter_cox-reg.R".
*** Note: If you are not able to automatically set your working directory, manually set the variable manualwd = 1 in "Data_node_call_cox-reg_k.R" and "Coord_node_call_iter_cox-reg.R".

These files call other R files based on what is the next step to be executed. Iteration sequence number (t) and node number (k) are imputed automatically from the file names where possible. 
An override can be applied if desired (see the comment section of the relevant files).

The execution assumes that the required files are available in the same folder as the R file.

The subfolder pooled_comparator contains code that can be used to execute a centralized Cox model. Make sure to read the code and make the needed adjustments before launching.

*** OF NOTE, this is PURELY to demonstrate the feasibility of distributed Cox models. The code here has NOT been optimised NOR made secure in a significant way.
*** A thorough review NEEDS to be undertaken before using this code in any production/research project
