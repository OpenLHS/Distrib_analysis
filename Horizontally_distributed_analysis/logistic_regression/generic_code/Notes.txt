The files in this folder can be used to support an example of distributed logistic regression analysis

Assuming a data structure similar to the data node csv files in the example folder, this code can be used to execute a data node operation or a coordination node operation for a logistic regression.

BAT command files are offered for windows users but similar ones can obviously be easily generated for other systems (these assume that RScript is in your system path). This requires the this.path package.

If you want to use RStudio, for the data node, you can source "Data_node_call_log-reg.R", and for the coordination node, it is "Coord_node_call_iter_log-reg.R".
*** If you are not able to automatically set your working directory, manually set the variable manualwd = 1 in Data_node_call_log-reg.R and Coord_node_call_iter_log-reg.R

These files calls other r files based on what is the next step to be executed. Iteration sequence number (t) and node number (k) are imputed automatically from the file names where possible. 
An override can be applied if desired (see the comment section of the relevant files)

The execution assumes that the required files are available in the same folder than the r file (for example, a primer file from the coordination node).

The subfoler "pooled_comparator" contains code that can be used to execute a traditional pooled logistic regression.

*** OF NOTE, this is PURELY to demonstrate the feasibility of distributed logistic regressions. The code here has NOT been optimised NOR made secure in a significant way.
*** A thorough review NEEDS to be undertaken before using this code in any production/research project.
