Random_data, Random_data_same_folder and Random_data_with_weights_same_folder are based on the same example.

The first one has the files separated in different folders to better mimic a distributed environment. To run, you need to copy the results across folders, which clarifies what is sent where.

The second example is based on the same dataset, but if you simply want to look at the output, everything is happening in the same folder, without the need to copy files across.

The third example is based on the same dataset and also uses weights. The weights used were chosen randomly.



MatchIt_data_with_weights and MatchIt_data_with_weights_same_folder are based on the same example. They both use the "Lalonde" data sets from the r package "MatchIt". See: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/index.html

For both examples, the weights are the ones obtained from running the content of the "Weights_generation_for_IPW" with the MatchIt example.

The first one has the files separated in different folders to better mimic a distributed environment. To run, you need to copy the results across folders, which clarifies what is sent where.

The second example is based on the same dataset, but if you simply want to look at the output, everything is happening in the same folder, without the need to copy files across.



The third example is based on the same dataset, but has some missing values. It shows how the complete case analysis will be done and how original data will be kept.



newborn_data_same_folder is yet another example.
